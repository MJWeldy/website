## Background

I am a wildlife ecologist and data scientist specializing in bioacoustics, machine learning, and conservation biology. Currently pursuing my PhD in Forest Ecosystems and Society at Oregon State University, I work at the intersection of technology and wildlife conservation to develop innovative solutions for monitoring and protecting threatened species.
