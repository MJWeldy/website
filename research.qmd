## Research Focus

My research integrates cutting-edge technology with conservation biology to address critical challenges in wildlife monitoring and ecosystem management. I specialize in developing machine learning and probabilistic tools for analyzing bioacoustic data, with applications to threatened species conservation and landscape-scale ecological monitoring.

## Current Projects

### Bioacoustic Monitoring of Threatened Species

**Northern Spotted Owl Population Dynamics**  
Developing integrated approaches combining historical territory data with passive acoustic monitoring to assess population trends and occupancy patterns of this federally threatened species.

**Marbled Murrelet Forest Habitat Use**  
Using convolutional neural networks and passive acoustic recorders to facilitate near real-time monitoring of marbled murrelets across forested landscapes, enabling better understanding of terrestrial habitat requirements.

### Machine Learning for Bioacoustics

**Audio Classification Under Data Scarcity**  
Developing simulated soundscape approaches to improve acoustic classifier performance when training data is limited, with applications to rare species detection.

**Individual Identification in Acoustic Recordings**  
Contributing to advancing methods for individual animal identification using acoustic signatures, with implications for demographic studies and population monitoring.

### Bayesian Statistical Methods

**Multi-state Occupancy Modeling**  
Developing methods to integrate long-term monitoring data across different survey methodologies, addressing spatial mismatch and methodological transitions in wildlife monitoring programs.

**Mark-Recapture Analysis**  
Investigating emigration effects on survival estimates and developing improved analytical approaches for small mammal demographic studies.
